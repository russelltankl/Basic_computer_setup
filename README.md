## Python
I usually use dual python version on my computer. Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to find the Python version you want to install. (Choose 64bit python versions)

During installation of both Python versions, make sure to not add them into PATH and install the location to C:\ .

Afterwords, go to System Environment Variables > Environment Variables > User Variables _ Path. Add the following lines into PATH.

```
C:\Python27
C:\Python27\Scripts
C:\Python37
C:\Python37\Scripts
```

After that, change .exe of each Python version to eg: python.exe > python2.exe .
